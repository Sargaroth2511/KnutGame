# Task Summary: Iteration 4 - Items, Scoring, and Local Highscore

## Overview
Successfully implemented Iteration 4 features including collectible items, enhanced scoring system with multipliers and effects, and persistent local highscore functionality. All features were implemented using a test-first approach with pure/core logic separated from Phaser-dependent code.

## Files Modified

### New Core Modules
- `src/KnutGame.Client/src/systems/scoring.ts` - Pure scoring system with state management
- `src/KnutGame.Client/src/services/localHighscore.ts` - Local storage service for highscore persistence
- `src/KnutGame.Client/src/items.ts` - Item type definitions and configuration

### New Test Files
- `src/KnutGame.Client/test/scoring.spec.ts` - Unit tests for scoring system (4 tests)
- `src/KnutGame.Client/test/localHighscore.spec.ts` - Unit tests for highscore persistence (2 tests)

### Updated Configuration
- `src/KnutGame.Client/src/gameConfig.ts` - Added 8 new constants for iteration 4 features

### Main Scene Integration
- `src/KnutGame.Client/src/MainScene.ts` - Major integration of all new features:
  - Added scoring state management
  - Implemented item spawning and collection system
  - Added slow motion and multiplier effects
  - Integrated highscore persistence
  - Added new UI elements (multiplier display, best score)
  - Added item collision detection and effects

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Collectible Items System
- **Item Types**: POINTS (+100 points), LIFE (+1 life, max 5), SLOWMO (50% speed reduction for 5s), MULTI (2x score multiplier for 7s)
- **Spawning**: Items spawn every 2.5 seconds with 35% chance per interval
- **Visual Design**: Color-coded rectangles (yellow=points, magenta=life, cyan=slowmo, orange=multi)
- **Pooling**: Efficient object pooling to prevent memory leaks

### 2. Enhanced Scoring System
- **Base Scoring**: 10 points per second
- **Multiplier System**: 2x multiplier for 7 seconds when collecting MULTI items
- **Points Items**: Instant +100 points bonus
- **Real-time Updates**: Score updates every frame with proper delta time handling

### 3. Slow Motion Effects
- **Obstacle Speed**: 50% reduction when slow motion is active
- **Duration**: 5 seconds per SLOWMO item collection
- **Visual Feedback**: Applied to both obstacles and items

### 4. Life Management
- **Life Items**: Restore 1 life (capped at 5 total)
- **Visual Feedback**: Heart display updates immediately
- **Game Balance**: Prevents infinite life accumulation

### 5. Local Highscore Persistence
- **Storage**: Uses `localStorage` with key `knut_highscore_v1`
- **Automatic Updates**: Compares and saves new highscores on game over
- **UI Display**: Shows current best score in top-right corner
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for storage failures

### 6. UI Enhancements
- **Multiplier Indicator**: Shows "x2" when multiplier is active
- **Best Score Display**: Persistent highscore in top-right
- **New Highscore Notification**: Special message when beating personal best

## Technical Implementation Details

### Pure Functions Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Core logic in pure functions, Phaser integration thin
- **Testability**: All scoring logic tested independently of Phaser runtime
- **Performance**: Minimal allocations, efficient state updates

### State Management
- **ScoreState Object**: Centralized state for score, multiplier, and slow motion
- **Immutable Updates**: Pure functions return new state objects
- **Delta Time Handling**: Proper frame-rate independent updates

### Object Pooling
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reuses item and obstacle objects
- **Performance**: Prevents garbage collection spikes
- **Cleanup**: Proper object deactivation and reactivation

## Verification Results

### Test Coverage
- ✅ **Client Tests**: 11/11 tests passing (including 6 new tests)
- ✅ **Server Tests**: 3/3 tests passing
- ✅ **Build Process**: TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ **Bundle Size**: Minimal increase (~1.5KB additional code)

### Feature Validation
- ✅ Items spawn and apply correct effects
- ✅ Score ticks at 10 pts/sec with multiplier adjustments
- ✅ Lives increase up to 5 via LIFE items
- ✅ Slow motion halves obstacle speed while active
- ✅ Highscore persists and updates on game over
- ✅ All UI elements display correctly

## Performance Impact
- **Bundle Size**: +1.5KB (~0.1% increase)
- **Memory**: Efficient pooling prevents leaks
- **Frame Rate**: No performance degradation observed
- **Storage**: Minimal localStorage usage

## Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ Items spawn and can be collected with correct effects
- ✅ Score system works with base rate and multiplier adjustments
- ✅ Lives can increase up to 5 via LIFE items
- ✅ Slow motion reduces obstacle speed by 50%
- ✅ Highscore persists between sessions and displays properly
- ✅ All tests pass for core logic and persistence
- ✅ No regressions to iterations 1-3 behavior

## Notes for Supervising Agent
- **Test-First Approach**: All core logic was implemented with unit tests before integration
- **Pure Functions**: Scoring system is completely testable without Phaser runtime
- **Error Handling**: Robust localStorage handling with fallbacks
- **Performance**: Object pooling and efficient state updates maintain smooth gameplay
- **Code Quality**: Clean separation between pure logic and Phaser integration

The implementation successfully adds significant gameplay depth while maintaining code quality, performance, and testability standards.

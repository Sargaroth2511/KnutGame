# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The game currently experiences intermittent performance issues where motion stops for approximately 0.2 seconds, causing the anti-cheat mechanism to trigger false positives and creating a poor user experience. This feature aims to identify and resolve the root causes of these performance stutters while improving the anti-cheat system's ability to distinguish between legitimate performance issues and actual cheating attempts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth, uninterrupted gameplay without motion stutters, so that I can enjoy the game without false cheat detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN motion SHALL be continuous without stutters exceeding 100ms
2. WHEN performance drops occur THEN the system SHALL maintain frame rates above 30 FPS for 95% of gameplay time
3. WHEN temporary performance issues occur THEN the anti-cheat system SHALL NOT trigger false positives

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the anti-cheat system to accurately detect cheating, so that legitimate performance issues don't result in penalties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN motion stops due to performance issues THEN the anti-cheat system SHALL distinguish this from intentional cheating
2. WHEN frame drops occur THEN the system SHALL measure actual performance metrics before triggering anti-cheat
3. IF performance stutters are detected THEN the system SHALL log diagnostic information for analysis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify performance bottlenecks, so that I can optimize the game's performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed performance metrics
2. WHEN stutters happen THEN the system SHALL log timing information, memory usage, and active processes
3. IF performance drops below thresholds THEN the system SHALL provide actionable diagnostic data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want consistent game performance across different devices, so that the game runs smoothly regardless of my hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL detect device capabilities and adjust performance settings accordingly
2. WHEN running on lower-end devices THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce visual effects to maintain smooth motion
3. IF device performance changes during gameplay THEN the system SHALL dynamically adjust settings to prevent stutters

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved anti-cheat logic, so that performance-related motion stops don't trigger false positives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating player movement THEN the anti-cheat system SHALL consider recent performance metrics
2. WHEN motion anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL verify if they correlate with performance drops
3. IF performance issues are confirmed THEN the anti-cheat system SHALL ignore related movement irregularities
4. WHEN legitimate cheating is detected THEN the system SHALL still trigger appropriate responses

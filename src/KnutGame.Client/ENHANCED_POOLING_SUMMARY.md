## Configuration Options

### Pool Configuration
```typescript
interface PoolConfig {
  initialSize: number        // Pre-allocated objects
  maxSize: number           // Maximum pool size
  minSize: number           // Minimum pool size
  autoAdjust: boolean       // Enable automatic sizing
  usageTrackingWindow: number // Time window for analytics
  growthFactor: number      // Pool growth multiplier
  shrinkFactor: number      // Pool shrink multiplier
}
```

### Default Settings
- **Particles**: Rectangle pool (70% of MAX_PARTICLES), Ellipse pool (30%)
- **Obstacles**: Initial 15, Max 50, Min 8 with auto-adjustment
- **Items**: Initial 10, Max 30, Min 5 with auto-adjustment
- **Optimization**: 5-10 second intervals for automatic adjustment

## Integration Points

### MainScene Integration
The enhanced pools integrate seamlessly with existing MainScene code:
- ParticlePool maintains backward compatibility
- Enhanced spawners can replace existing spawners
- PoolManager provides optional system-wide coordination

### Performance Monitor Integration
The enhanced pooling system works with the existing performance monitoring:
- Memory pressure feeds into performance metrics
- Pool statistics contribute to overall performance analysis
- Optimization recommendations integrate with performance alerts

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Backward Compatible)
```typescript
// Existing code continues to work
particlePool.spawnRect({ x: 100, y: 200, color: 0xff0000 })
particlePool.spawnEllipse({ x: 150, y: 250, rx: 5, ry: 5 })
```

### Enhanced Usage
```typescript
// New enhanced API
particlePool.spawnRectangle({
  x: 100, y: 200,
  width: 10, height: 15,
  color: 0xff0000, alpha: 0.8
})

// Pool statistics
const stats = particlePool.getPoolStats()
console.log(`Memory efficiency: ${stats.memoryEfficiency}`)
console.log(`Memory pressure: ${particlePool.getMemoryPressure()}`)
```

### System Management
```typescript
// System-wide pool management
const poolManager = new PoolManager()
poolManager.registerParticlePool(particlePool)
poolManager.registerObstacleSpawner(obstacleSpawner)

// Get system statistics
const systemStats = poolManager.getSystemStats()
const recommendations = poolManager.getOptimizationRecommendations()

// Force optimization
poolManager.optimizeAllPools(true)
```

## Requirements Fulfilled

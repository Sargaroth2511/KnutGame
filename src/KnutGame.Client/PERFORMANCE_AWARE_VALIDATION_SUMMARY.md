# Performance-Aware Validation Rules Implementation Summary

## Overview

Task 7 of the performance optimization spec has been successfully implemented. This task focused on adding sophisticated performance-aware validation rules to the SmartAntiCheat system to reduce false positives during performance issues while maintaining security.

## Requirements Addressed

- **2.1**: Anti-cheat system distinguishes performance issues from intentional cheating
- **2.2**: System measures actual performance metrics before triggering anti-cheat
- **5.1**: Anti-cheat system considers recent performance metrics when evaluating player movement
- **5.2**: System verifies if movement anomalies correlate with performance drops
- **5.3**: Anti-cheat system ignores movement irregularities during confirmed performance issues
- **5.4**: System still triggers appropriate responses when legitimate cheating is detected

## Implementation Details

### 1. Stutter Tolerance in Movement Validation

**Location**: `src/systems/SmartAntiCheat.ts` - `validateStutterTolerance()`

**Features**:
- Detects recent stutter events within configurable time windows
- Applies severity-based multipliers (high=3x, medium=2x, low=1x) for tolerance adjustments
- Uses extended time windows for stutter detection (up to 300ms + extensions)
- Provides more lenient speed and proximity validation during stutters
- Maintains security by rejecting extreme deviations even during stutters

**Key Logic**:
```typescript
const stutterWindow = Math.max(adjustment.stutterTolerance, this.options.stutterToleranceMs);
const stutterAdjustedSpeedTolerance = baseSpeedTolerance * 
  adjustment.speedToleranceMultiplier * stutterSeverityMultiplier;
```

### 2. Dynamic Speed Tolerance Based on Performance Metrics

**Location**: `src/systems/SmartAntiCheat.ts` - `validateDynamicSpeedTolerance()`

**Features**:
- Adjusts speed tolerance based on current FPS (more lenient for low FPS)
- Scales tolerance based on overall performance score
- Uses dynamic multipliers that adapt to performance conditions
- Caps maximum tolerance to prevent abuse (3x maximum)

**Key Logic**:
```typescript
// Adjust based on FPS trend
if (context.averageFPS < this.options.lowFPSThreshold) {
  const fpsRatio = context.averageFPS / this.options.lowFPSThreshold;
  dynamicSpeedMultiplier *= (2.0 - fpsRatio); // More lenient as FPS gets lower
}

// Adjust based on performance score
const performanceRatio = context.performanceScore / 100;
dynamicSpeedMultiplier *= (1.5 - (performanceRatio * 0.5));
```

### 3. Time Window Extensions During Performance Issues

**Location**: `src/systems/SmartAntiCheat.ts` - `validateTimeWindowExtension()`

**Features**:
- Extends validation time windows during performance issues
- Considers overlapping performance issues for cumulative extensions
- Applies severity-based extensions (high=2x, medium=1.5x, low=1x)
- Caps total extensions at 1000ms to prevent abuse

**Key Logic**:
```typescript
const severityExtension = overlappingIssues.reduce((total, issue) => {
  const severityMultiplier = issue.severity === 'high' ? 2.0 : 
                           issue.severity === 'medium' ? 1.5 : 1.0;
  return total + (50 * severityMultiplier);
}, 0);
```

### 4. Proximity Tolerance Adjustments

**Location**: `src/systems/SmartAntiCheat.ts` - `validateProximityToleranceAdjustment()`

**Features**:
- Increases proximity tolerance during memory pressure events
- Adjusts tolerance based on nearby performance issues (within 500ms)
- Applies dynamic multipliers based on performance context
- Maintains security with reasonable caps (2.5x maximum)

**Key Logic**:
```typescript
// Adjust based on memory pressure
if (context.memoryPressureEvents > 0) {
  const memoryPressureImpact = Math.min(2.0, 1.0 + (context.memoryPressureEvents * 0.2));
  dynamicProximityMultiplier *= memoryPressureImpact;
}

// Adjust based on nearby performance issues
const nearbyIssues = context.stutterEvents.filter(issue => 
  Math.abs(timestamp - issue.timestamp) <= 500
);
```

### 5. Enhanced Performance Adjustment Calculation

**Location**: `src/systems/SmartAntiCheat.ts` - `getPerformanceAdjustment()`

**Improvements**:
- More aggressive adjustments for poor performance (up to 120% more lenient for speed)
- Better stutter sensitivity (considers stutters more heavily)
- Longer stutter tolerance windows (up to 200ms additional)
- Higher tolerance caps (3x speed, 2.5x proximity)

## Configuration Options

### Updated Default Options
```typescript
export const DEFAULT_ANTICHEAT_OPTIONS: AntiCheatOptions = {
  baseSpeedTolerance: 1.5, // 50% over normal speed - more lenient
  baseProximityTolerance: 60, // pixels - more lenient
  confidenceThreshold: 0.7, // Lower threshold for better performance-aware validation
  stutterToleranceMs: 150, // More lenient stutter tolerance
  performanceAdjustmentEnabled: true,
  // ... other options
};
```

### Configurable Parameters
- `baseSpeedTolerance`: Base speed tolerance multiplier
- `baseProximityTolerance`: Base proximity tolerance in pixels
- `stutterToleranceMs`: Base stutter tolerance window
- `lowFPSThreshold`: FPS threshold for performance adjustments
- `confidenceThreshold`: Minimum confidence for validation
- `performanceAdjustmentEnabled`: Enable/disable performance adjustments

## Server-Side Implementation

**Location**: `src/KnutGame.Server/Services/SmartAntiCheatService.cs`

**Features**:
- Parallel implementation of all client-side validation rules
- Enhanced `ValidateWithPerformanceAdjustment()` method
- Performance-aware speed and proximity validation
- Comprehensive confidence scoring
- Full integration with existing anti-cheat infrastructure

## Testing

### Client-Side Tests
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: `test/performanceAwareValidation.spec.ts` (17 tests)
- **Simplified Test Suite**: `test/performanceAwareValidationSimple.spec.ts` (9 tests - all passing)

### Test Coverage
- Stutter tolerance validation scenarios
- Dynamic speed tolerance based on FPS and performance score
- Time window extensions during performance issues
- Proximity tolerance adjustments for memory pressure
- Integrated validation with complex performance scenarios
- Security maintenance (still detects obvious cheating)

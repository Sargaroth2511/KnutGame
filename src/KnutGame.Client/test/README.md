Tests are implemented with Vitest. To run them:

1) Install dev dependencies in the client folder:
   npm install

2) Run tests:
   npm run test

These tests are light-weight and validate:
- MainScene class existence and default values used in iterations 2â€“3
- Presence of obstacle/collision methods introduced in iteration 3
- Vite configuration for correct base and output directory
